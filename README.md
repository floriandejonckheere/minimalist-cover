# README

This is my minimalist cover page. It uses a Grunt build system in order to compile the SCSS stylesheets. The source HTML files are in the `src/html` directory, which uses a templating system to insert the headers and footers in each document. The source SCSS files are in the `src/scss` folder.

The compiled files are available in the `dist` folder.

## Building

Development:

```
$ grunt watch
```
