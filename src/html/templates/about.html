    Hi there! My name is Florian Dejonckheere. I'm a student applied computer science and spare time developer located in Ghent, Belgium. At the moment, I'm really into Ruby on Rails and building dynamic web applications. My other interests include programming, systems engineering and modding the occasional spare laptop into an entertainment system or media server.
