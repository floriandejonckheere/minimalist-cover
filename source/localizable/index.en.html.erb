<h1>
  Hello there!<br />
  My name is Florian
</h1>
<p>
  I'm a Ruby on Rails developer from Belgium. I like thinking about software architecture and design patterns. I'm currently working at <a href="https://openwebslid.es/">Open Webslides</a>, an innovative collaboration platform allowing teachers and students to co-create on interactive course content.
</p>

  This website was custom designed and written by me. It was realized as a practical study in typography and minimalism. Like almost all of my work, the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/floriandejonckheere/portfolio" target="_blank">Github</a>.
